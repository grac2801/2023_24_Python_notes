    #============================================================================
    #    Student activity 2:
    # It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years,
    # However, this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach 
    # adulthood in approximately 2 years. 
    # As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the 
    # first 2 human years ad 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional 
    # human year a 4 dog years.
    # Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to 
    # dog years described. Ensure your program works correctly.
    # Should a negative value be input, the program should advise user of the
    # issue.
